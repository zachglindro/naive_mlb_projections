# Naive MLB projections
Projects next-season wRC+ using linear regression based on previous season wRC+, age, and HardHit%, among others. Model is trained on 2015-2023 data (minimum 300 PA in each season), excluding 2020. The model works well on players with >300 PA, and conversely does not work well on players with <300 PA.
