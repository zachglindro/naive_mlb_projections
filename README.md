# Naive MLB projections
Projects next-season wRC+, BB%, and K% using only previous season's stats.

Linear regression models are trained on 2015-2023 data (minimum 300 PA in each season), excluding 2020. Each set of projections are independent from each other. 2024 projections only include players who have accumulated 300 PA in 2023.
