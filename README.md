# Naive MLB projections
Projects next-season wRC+, BB%, and K% using only previous season's stats. Linear regression models are trained on 2015-2023 data (minimum 300 PA in each season), excluding 2020. They work well on players with >300 PA, and conversely do not work well on players with <300 PA. Each set of projections are independent from each other (i.e., projected wRC+ doesn't use projected BB%/K%).
